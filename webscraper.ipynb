Furthermore, the course stresses the importance of developing an international perspective and cross-cultural sensitivity to organizational behaviour issues.  Interpersonal and group skills and new ways of dealing with issues ranging from ethical use of organizationally based power to technological change to work-force diversity are introduced.
